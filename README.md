# Recency-Frequency-Monetary-Clustering-of-Online-Customers
I describe the methods used to cluster customers of a Brazilian online retailer by customers recency, frequency, and monetary value of purchases

## Introduction
In today's world of online retail, it is critical to a businesses survival to know who their customers are and how those customers behave. Today's consumers develop a relationship with the brands and retailers they choose to do business with. In order for that relationship to not end in a break up, retailers must provide a much more personal touch with targeted and personalized communication that speaks to the individual needs of each customer. The problem with a personalized approach is that online retailers can have such a wide range of consumers as opposed to a brick in mortar store in a fixed location. Creating something personalized for each individual is a nearly impossible task, but the good news is that we can gain an indepth understanding of the customer base by clustering customers with similar behavior! In this example, I will show how clustering to achieve a better targeted marketing approach can be done using customers' recency of last purchase, how frequent they have shopped, and how much they have spent an Brazilian Amazon type of online retailer.
